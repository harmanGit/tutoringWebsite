 Your website has a home page, a page for tutoring HTML5 and a page for tutoring CSS. The homepage describes the
 purpose of this website and has a Table of Contents, each item can be clicked by the users to go to a page for
 that item.

 To make your homepage interesting, provide a link to a page that allows the users to play a game. This game generates
 integer between 0(inclusive) and 1000(exclusive) and prompts the user to enter an integer with at most 3 digits. This
 game needs to user pay $1 to play. If the integer entered by the user matches the integer generated in any order, the
 user wins $249 and s/he losses the $1 payed.

 Your website should answer all the questions in quiz #1 aesthetically and cohesively (don't make it like a quiz)

 Your website should also cover grouped CSS selector, context dependent selectors, font properties , text properties
 and CSS pseudo-classes.

 For each concept or style, you need to have a description, example code and example display. Recall that you need to
 use code to display special characters. for example, your page may display the following when you discuss inline CSS.
